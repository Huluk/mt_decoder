\section*{Q2}
We modified the old $h(j,e)$ so that each recursion step reads two phrases
instead of one. The second of these phrases (in the French sentence) may be
the empty phrase $\varepsilon$. The two phrases are always swapped in the
translation. If the second phrase was $\varepsilon$, swapping has no effect
on the translation. Thus the translation is equivalent to a non-swap.
Our full definition of $h(j,e)$ is specified as follows:
