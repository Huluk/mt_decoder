\section*{Q2}
We modified the old $h(j,e)$ so that each recursion step reads two French
phrases +instead of one. The second of these phrases may be either an actual
phrase or an artificial  empty phrase $\varepsilon$, which we have added to
the translation dictionary. The $\varepsilon$ phrase is an empty string,
which translates with probability one to an empty string. The two read
phrases are always swapped in the translation. In case of the second phrase
being $\varepsilon$, the swapping is only nominal and the resulting
translation is as if no swapping was performed.  Our full definition of
$h(j,e)$ is specified as follows:
