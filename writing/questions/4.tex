\section*{Q4}

In our implementation the mapping from hypotheses to stacks is the same in the decoder with local reordering as it was in the one without. Each hypothesis is placed on a stack corresponding to the index of last French word being translated. We do not create hypotheses in which French phrases are skipped, but instead always look at two consecutive phrases, swap then, and create a hypothesis which covers both phrases. This means that mapping onto stacks is straightforward, since the number of French words covered by a hypothesis is always the same as the index of the last word which it translates.
