honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ?
a committee selection was achievement .
yesterday I attended on the first meeting of the committee .
and I expected the committee rise that no knew too what to do of senators independent .
that will concern not so for the time .
the committee selection can show some impact .
on the work that strikes a senator within the next two years .
it is a committee important as , supposedly , these nine senators actually in its committee sit some senators .
my so presented to the sitting of the committee yesterday ' s to realize that one of the nine senators not attend .
he had sent a replacement .
honourable senators , I do name people .
you can see so that I am kind ' t it ?
the Senate will have their own research to find that had been because .
when an individual accepts an work , it must the do .
women ' who sit on the Senate have proven .
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate .
I recall of the hold that held the to the committee of veterans in February 1998 .
Ni the Senate or the House of Commons do not here at that time .
three senators Liberal saw to proceedings of the committee , all of women .
the leadership of the Senate could not find a man to the committee .
I could cite , word about word , which the hon. senator Carstairs took answered the question I asked .
I asked : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? "
it has said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report .
that she had wrote on the parliamentary associations in 1993 .
Les delegations at the time were formées only of men .
in this regard , on I was replaced by the senator Finestone for a number of years .
however , I look again the opportunity to back my association preferred .
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be decision on these two reports .
that each the Senate are verdict on television .
or wondered by a group of students , of journalists or any .
that say we do ?
it is true , and I will believe .
but it should be bring in fact .
I think out of the replacing .
if a senator accepts an position in a committee , he or it should part of all the meetings intended .
we are not of members which the words in the corridors :
" Présentez do you in committee today and after two years of school , there is a vote final in committee '' .
they do not even know what they are considers , they stand came to when their leadership stand to them .
they do not know no what happened .
honourable senators , the words " continuité " and " dedication '' is the way in our speech .
in the next two weeks , start to consider the way we will into the senators independent .
if we do the are not , I créerai my own committee as parliamentarians who are concerned about the world affairs .
no one can there try .
the Honour the Speaker :
if any other hon. senator is wishes to speak , you is it the pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
well .
( motions deemed adopted , and the report agreed to )
